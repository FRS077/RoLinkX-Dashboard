## How to install RoLink
```
bash <(curl -s https://rolink.network/install.sh)
```

## Steps to install RoLinkX Dashboard
 1. Clone to your device ( `git clone https://github.com/yo6nam/RoLinkX-Dashboard` )
 2. Change dir to RoLinkX-Dashboard ( `cd RoLinkX-Dashboard/` )
 3. Execute setup.sh ( `sudo ./setup.sh` )<br>

Or, single line : 
```
git clone https://github.com/yo6nam/RoLinkX-Dashboard;cd RoLinkX-Dashboard/;sudo ./setup.sh
```

Or, using RoLink init script:
```
/opt/rolink/scripts/init dash
```
## How to update
Use the "Update Dashboard" button from the Config page (most convenient) or execute the installation steps  
If you've kept the cloned folder (it's usually in %home% directory), use
```
cd ~/RoLinkX-Dashboard/;git pull;sudo ./setup.sh
```

 Some basic checks and automagic mods are applied by the setup script but please note<br>
 "Network Manager **WILL BE** disabled"  
 
 Once installed, open a browser and access :<br>
 **http://device_hostname/rolink**    --*or*--    **http://<device_ip>/rolink**
 
 You should be greeted with something like this

 On a fresh OS install you will need to reboot about three times :
 1. After RoLink (custom precompiled SVXLink) client installation & if the sound card is not configured
 2. If Network Manager is found to be enabled and running upon executing *setup.sh*
 3. After saving your first pair of SSID/Key using the Wi-Fi page

# Notes
1. For SA818_V5.x FW version (check with AT+VERSION command) the serial port will only work after a cold boot
and stop responding after a reboot. A cause/fix remains to be determined.  
Solution : Shut down, remove power from OrangePi for a few sconds, power up and try programming the SA818 module.  

2. Converting the File System to read-only state can be achieved using the "Make FS read-only" button from the Config page or by using the RoLink installation script (Option #5)


**Good luck!**
